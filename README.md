# Wabbajack-AutoClickDownload
A simple autoclicker made to be used while downloading large modpacks from Nexus with Wabbajack.

AutoHotKey is necessary.

Instructions:

1 - Use the snipper tool or a similar alternative to take a small screenshot of the Slow Download button.
 
2 - Edit Wabbajack.ahk and replace "E:\Mods\slow-download.png" with your own directory and the name of the screenshot you took.

It is recommended to tweak the Sleep values, what works for me might not work for you.
